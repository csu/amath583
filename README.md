========

Some small experiments to practice concepts taught in AMATH 583. No homeworks/solutions included.

Note: most FORTRAN/OpenMP-related projects are in my [LearningFortran repository](https://github.com/csu/LearningFortran). This was used more for the IPython/Sage/etc. parts of the class. I'll probably put some larger projects/lecture-related projects here.
